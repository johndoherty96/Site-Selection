<h1>GIS-Driven Site Selection for Nature Conservation Amidst Urbanization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Rapid urbanization globally has led to a biodiversity crisis comparable to a mass extinction event, with plant and animal species being displaced and extinguished. The United States, with the second-highest rate of species extinction, exemplifies this through the drastic decline of the American Buffalo population from 30-60 million in the 1800s to only a few hundred by 1900 due to westward expansion. This lesson explores nature conservation and the use of GIS tools to select ideal sites for nature reserves. As a GIS Analyst for the non-profit consulting group PSUGIS Unlimited, the task is to perform a site selection analysis in Centre County, Pennsylvania, to identify suitable areas for establishing a nature reserve. The selected areas must meet criteria such as having over 70 bird and mammalian species, minimal road coverage, high habitat potential, public land ownership, forest coverage, and slopes below 10%.
